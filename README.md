> **Tracking the frontier of Generative AI: Flow Matching, Diffusion Models, and Diffusion Flow.**

This repository is a curated, **daily-updated** collection of the latest research papers from ArXiv. It is designed for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts who want to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving field of continuous-time generative models.

## 🚀 Why Follow This Repository?

The field of Generative AI is moving fast. New techniques like **Flow Matching** and **Rectified Flow** are challenging the dominance of standard Diffusion Models. Keeping up with the daily influx of papers is exhausting.

This repository solves that by:
1.  **Automating Discovery**: We fetch papers every 24 hours directly from ArXiv.
2.  **Focusing on Quality**: Filtering for the most relevant keywords in the domain.
3.  **Archiving History**: Maintaining a structured log of research progress over time.

| **Advanced Theory** | `Stochastic Interpolants`, `Rectified Flow`, `Schrödinger Bridge`, `Optimal Transport` |
| **Applications** | `Image Generation`, `3D Generation`, `Molecular Generation` |

**Target ArXiv Categories:**
* `cs.LG` (Machine Learning)
* `cs.CV` (Computer Vision)
* `cs.AI` (Artificial Intelligence)
* `stat.ML` (Machine Learning)
* `math.PR` (Probability)

## 🛠️ How It Works

This repository is maintained by an automated pipeline:
1.  **Fetcher**: A Python script queries the ArXiv API for specific keywords.
2.  **Filter**: Papers are filtered by date (last 24h) and relevance.
3.  **Formatter**: Metadata (Title, Abstract, Authors, Code Links) is extracted and formatted into Markdown.
4.  **Publisher**: GitHub Actions pushes the update to this repository and archives the old data.

*Powered by [ArXiv_Paper_Fetcher](https://github.com/ruiyli/ArXiv_Paper_Fetcher).*
